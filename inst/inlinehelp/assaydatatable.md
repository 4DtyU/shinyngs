This panel is provided to allow view and download of all the basic matrix data present in the `assays` slots of the input data structure.

#### Data structure

Data are organised into 'experiments', each of which can have a different set of rows (features). For example in an RNA-seq study one experiment might be used to represent transcripts, another to represent genes. Each experiment then has multiple 'assays', a set of measurements of the same features and samples. This could be different assays, or different levels of processing etc. 

#### Controls

Controls are provided to select an experiment and assay, as well as the rows and columns of that matrix. You can also choose to summarise the data, creating means by sample group.
