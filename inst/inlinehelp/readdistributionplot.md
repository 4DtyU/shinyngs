#### Introduction

This is a read distribution plot, showing how read data for this experiment overlap with known genomic features. It can be very informative, for example in working out why on a small proportion of reads end up contributing to transcript quantification.

A read will be counted more than once where it's spliced and assigned to multiple features.

These data are often geneated with tools like RSeQC [1] - but check with the analyst.
