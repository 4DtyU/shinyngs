## Synopsis

Shiny layouts for next-generation sequencing applications. Provides Shiny applications for various array and NGS applications. Currently very RNA-seq centric, with plans for expansion.

## Code Example

TODO: Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Shiny apps are great for NGS and bioinformatics applications in general. But apps can get monstrous when their complexity increases, and it's not always easy to re-use components. This is an effort to create modularised components (e.g. a heatmap with controls), re-used to produce multiple shiny apps.

## Installation

TODO: Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

TODO: Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

TODO: Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

TODO: Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
